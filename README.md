# RustCLITextEditor

Following from the tutorial https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-1/ to re-create the 'Hecto' CLI text editor. I am using the opportunity to solidify my knowledge in Rust and learning many new insights from the tutorial regarding the nature of terminals and other low level insights that I had previously not yet explored. I am also taking the opportunity to write the entire code base in VIM CLI text editor and making the effort to learn the VIM hotkeys/shortcuts that are available so I can add this to my repertoire of skills as a developer.
